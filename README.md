  ## Description
  This application is a back end for an e-commerce site.  It uses the Express.js API and Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.  A dotenv package is used to store sensitive data.  The database interaction is through Insomnia.  There are various RESTful CRUD operations that allow interaction with all the tables in the database.

  ## Installation
  To install this application you must first clone the repository from Github. In the terminal you must install NPM by entering "npm init -y", then "npm i". Once this is complete you must create and populate your env file in order to access the db through SQL. Then you must create the db and tables in MYSQL by using the schema in the db folder. You can seed the db by typing in "npm run seed" in your terminal. Once everything is populated you can spin up your server by typing in "npm start" in your terminal. This will launch the application. There is no front end to this application so all interaction with the db is done through Insomnia. If you have any more questions please watch the video in this README or email me at christolnai@gmail.com.
